        <h2><br><br><br>Cities to Visit</h2>
        <p> In Peru, there are many beutiful cities to visit. Among them are the following:<ul>
        <li> Cusco
        <li>Pisac
        <li>Arequipa
        <li>Tarapoto
        <li>Iquitos
        <li>Quillabamba
        </ul>
        <strong>Cusco</strong> is the Incan capital of the world, and is the name of both a <em>province</em> and the capital city of that province. It is also my home. Cusco is located in the Andes mountains in Southern Peru, situated at 11,000 feet. Denver boasts their mile high stadium, but here people play soccer at twice that altitude.<br><br>
        <strong>Pisac</strong> is a small town <em>outside</em> of Cusco. It is situated in the <strong>sacred valley</strong>; a valley that is stunningly beautiful. Trust me, I know. The Urubamba river runs through the valley, and the surrounding area is very green. This town has a big outdoor market for selling souveneirs to tourists.<br><br>
        <strong>Arequipa</strong> is Peru's <em><strong>second largest city</strong></em>, and home to most of the nation's manufacturing. Anything from soda to concrete is manufactured in this dry region of Peru. Arequipa is the capital of the province Arequipa that borders Cusco. Arequipa is located in the desert, and surrounded by three volcanoes; the most famous of which is <strong>Mt. Misti</strong>. Mt. Misti is so named because it is always surrounded by clouds or haze, and therefore is hard to get a good picture of.<br><br>
        <strong>Tarapoto</strong> is a city of about <em>200,000</em> people in the northern region of Peru. It is located in the <strong>San Mart√≠n Province</strong>. This city is in the jungle. It is a beutiful place to visit, as all the plants are very green. There is also a place to jump off a small waterfall and into the pools below.<br><br>
        <strong>Iquitos</strong> is the capital city of Peru's northern-most and largest province Loreto. I don't know very much about Iquitos, as I've never visited.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Quillabamba</strong> is a city a few hours from Cusco that is in the High Jungle. Many delicious pineapples come from Quillabamba. Near Quillabamba are some hot-springs that are popular with tourists. <em>Cocalmayo</em> is the name of the hot-springs.
    <p>
        
        <h2>Foods to Eat</h2>
        <p> In Peru, there are many delicious foods to eat. Among these are the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Aji de Gallina
        <li>Lomo Saltado
        <li>Juane
        <li>Cuy
        <li>Pollo A La Brassa
        </ul>
        <strong>Aji de Gallina</strong> is a delicious meal that consists of shredded chicken mixed in a sauce made of onions, cheese, peanuts, and the aji pepper poured over rice. Placed on top of this delicious meal are black olives and boiled eggs. This meal is seriously good. It is one of my favourites.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Lomo Saltado</strong> is another delicious meal. It consists of a sauce containing beef, onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce poured over rice. Most people eat their Lomo Saltado with homemade fries on top.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Juane</strong> is a pretty good meal, but isn't my favourite. It is a meal that can be procured in the jungle. There is only one restalurant in Cusco that sells juane, and they over-price it. Juane is chicken and rice wrapped in a banana leaf, and boiled. It can be bought on the street in the jungle for 5-10 soles, the equivalent of about 1-3 dollars. But in the restaurant in Cusco, it can be up to five times that much.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Cuy</strong> is an overrated delicacy, enjoyed primarily by the Quechuas. Cuy is guinea pig. In the United States the guinea pig is a pet. In Peru it is food. The most common type of cuy is cuy al horno. Cuy al horno is just baked cuy. Nothing too special. But if you are going to come visit Peru, you have to try it.
    <br><br>
    
    Last, but most certainly not least is my personal favourite--<strong>Pollo A La Brassa</strong>. This a meal that consists of chicken roast on a spit with special spices. It is served in restaurants called Pollerias along with fries, and salad. Most Pollerias have their own recipie of aji sauce. This is a spicy sauce made from the aji pepper. These sauces usually contain peanuts.<p>
        
        <h2>Insight into the Culture</h2>
        <p>The Peruvian culture will vary greatly depending on where you are. In the jungle, the culture is open and friendly. In the mountains, it is a little bit colder but still more friendly and open than in the States. But the Quechua people generally distrust outsiders because they have been taken advantage of many times. In Cusco, the economy and government tends to be more Socialistic, although it isn't yet at the Communism stage.<p>
        
        <h2>Languages Spoken</h2>
        <p>There are hundreds of languages spoken in Peru, but the two most common languages are <strong>Spanish</strong>, and different variations of <strong>Quechua</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>Popular Sights</h2>
        <p>Many popular sights that you must visit if you come to Peru are <ul>
            <li>Machu Picchu
            <li>Nazca Drawings
            <li>Pisac Ruins
            <li>Sacqsaihuaman
            
        </ul>
